Lich & Vampire theme mod for Minecraft 1.21.4

Work in progress

Could not for the life of me get the geckolib block entities to work so the
base here shamelessly taken from
[geckolib-examples repo](https://github.com/bernie-g/geckolib-examples/tree/919947d85eb16d49d1a4fdd25818a210cfa9a6db)

thank you bernie-g

Plus that gives us the multiloader setup as well//


This does have nix dev support; on a flake enabled system you can run `nix develop` to pull in nessesary dependencies for the Minecraft client while developing.

You can take a look at the configuration at `flake.nix`
